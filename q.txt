1. Implement a Singleton Class using C++. And prove that it is working fine.
2. Write a single Sum function capable of handling an arbitrary number of integers. It should take two arguments and return an integer. (Do it recursively)
3. Show the Shallow Copy and the Deep Copy concepts using the nested class concepts. E.g. Class X would have Class Y (Has-a relationship). Class Y could also be a stand-alone class. 
4. Write a C++ code where a Parent class cannot be freed (destructor called) until the Child class instance is freed.
